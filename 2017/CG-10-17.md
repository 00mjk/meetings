## Agenda items

1. Opening, welcome and roll call
    1. Opening of the meeting
    1. Introduction of attendees
1. Find volunteers for note taking (acting chair to volunteer)
1. Adoption of the agenda
1. Proposals and discussions
    1. [Versioning of external standard dependencies](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues/566) (Andreas Rossberg).
    1. Web platform test repository, discussion, and poll (Ben Titzer).
       1. Background: The [Web Platform Tests repository](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) is W3C-coordinated attempt to build a cross-browser testsuite for the Web-platform stack. It incorporates tests from many sources and offers, for example, a two-way sync feature between the Chromium repository and WPT in an effect to make it much easier to expand the WPT tests. The WPT effort would like to incorporate as many WASM tests as possible and run them in a cross-browser fashion, and make it easy to add tests.
       The issue is complicated by a build step that is necessary, since WASM spec tests are almost all written using the text format, which requires translation to binaries and JS files for running in engines that have a JS embedding.
       1. Discussion of proposals
           1. Preserve status quo, add additional mirroring in WPT of WASM spec repository
              1. WASM spec repo continues to be source of truth
              1. 1-way sync WASM spec -> WPT
              1. Enforce no-editing in WPT mirror of subdirectory
              1. V8/Chakra/SpiderMonkey/JSC contributors can land spec tests
           1. Change status quo, WPT becomes the source of truth
              1. Build a 2-way sync between V8 (other engines) and WPT
              1. WASM spec changes must include a spec branch/PR and a WPT branch/PR
       1. Poll on proposals
           1. Should we consider moving the WASM source of truth to the WPT repository?
1. Closure
