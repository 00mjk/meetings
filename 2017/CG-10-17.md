## Agenda items

1. Opening, welcome and roll call
    1. Opening of the meeting
    1. Introduction of attendees
1. Find volunteers for note taking (acting chair to volunteer)
1. Adoption of the agenda
1. Proposals and discussions
    1. [Versioning of external standard dependencies](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues/566) (Andreas Rossberg).
    1. Web platform test repository, discussion, and poll (Ben Titzer).
       1. Background: The [Web Platform Tests repository](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) is W3C-coordinated attempt to build a cross-browser testsuite for the Web-platform stack. It incorporates tests from many sources and offers, for example, a two-way sync feature between the Chromium repository and WPT in an effort to make it much easier to expand the WPT tests. The WPT effort would like to incorporate as many WASM tests as possible and run them in a cross-browser fashion, and make it easy to add tests.
       The issue is complicated by a build step that is necessary, since WASM spec tests are almost all written using the text format, which requires translation to binaries and JS files for running in engines that have a JS embedding.
       1. Discussion of proposals
           1. Preserve status quo, add additional mirroring in WPT of WASM spec repository
              1. WASM spec repo continues to be source of truth
              1. 1-way sync WASM spec -> WPT (automated)
              1. Enforce no-editing in WPT mirror of subdirectory
              1. Wasm participants can land spec tests. PRs welcome from browser engines.
           1. Change status quo, spec repo continues to be the source of truth
              1. 2-way sync of spec repo into stand-alone engine repos V8/Chakra, and browser engines Firefox/JSC.
              1. Running Ocaml conversion etc. requires a pre-submit step done by committer, with output included in the commit.
              1. V8/Chakra/SpiderMonkey/JSC contributors can land spec tests (in their home project repos, or in the spec repo directly)
           1. Change status quo, WPT becomes the source of truth
              1. Build a 2-way sync between V8 + Chakra for a slice of WPT (reuse existing mirror for others)
              1. V8/Chromium/Chakra/SpiderMonkey/JSC contributors can land spec tests (in their home project repos, or in WPT directly)
              1. WASM spec changes must include a spec branch/PR and a WPT branch/PR
           1. [Detailed (v8 specific) doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FEjBpsIj1vu5ZUJI6ki6xKBFIijxlPj_rQmsucMMQrg/edit#)
       1. Poll on proposals
           1. WASM should maintain the source of truth by having compliance tests in the spec repo, as today.
           1. Tests contributed to the WASM spec repo should receive review from core contributors. 
1. Closure
