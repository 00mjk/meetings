and 

#### 11:30am - 12:30pm : WebAssembly Visits WebPerf

The Web Performance WG is discussing the
[Lifecycle API](https://github.com/spanicker/web-lifecycle/blob/master/README.md).

Ben will give a high level overview of WebAssembly.

#### 3:00pm - 4:00pm : Toolchains
Presenter: *Derek Schuff*

Emscripten is WebAssembly's toolchain.
Derek will give an introduction on how to use it, tips and tricks, and where it's going.

#### 4:00pm - 5:00pm : Demos

Come see Demos of WebAssembly:
* Google Earth (preview) - Live demo only
* [WebDSP](https://d2jta7o2zej4pf.cloudfront.net/)

* [Epic Zen Garden](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mozilla-games/ZenGarden/EpicZenGarden.html)
* [WebSight](https://websightjs.com/)
* [NASA Access Mars](https://accessmars.withgoogle.com/)

### Day 2 : Tuesday, November 7th

#### 8:00am - 10:00am : Open Discussion

Swing by and talk about WebAssembly!
WebAssembly folks and others can discuss topics of interest.

#### 11:00am - 12:00 : Exceptions and Control-flow in WebAssembly
Presenter + Moderator: *Heejin Ahn*
* Presentation on Control-flow in WebAssembly + current state of exceptions proposal
* Discussion

#### 12:00am - 2:00pm : Lunch

Free-form mingling in the WebAssembly Room

#### 2:00pm - 3:30pm : GPU for the Web Community Group
Presenter + Moderator: *Corentin Wallez*
* Presentation on WebGPU
* Discussion of WebGPU Topics, especially Wasm related ones:
    * Fast bindings for Web platform APIs (call overhead and GC-less render loop)
    * How to make the API interoperable between JS and WASM
    * Is the WASM host mapping buffers in the WASM module memory space a thing? (glMapBuffer equivalent)
    * Multithreading story for APIs
    * API extensibility in WASM (can't just add a dictionary entry like JS)
    *Any questions you might have!

#### 3:30pm - 4:00pm : Abusing WebAssembly
Moderator: *Brad Nelson*

Discussion on what bearing coing mining and other CPU abuse has on WebAssembly.
Follow up discussion of [Lifecycle API](https://github.com/spanicker/web-lifecycle/blob/master/README.md).

#### 4:00pm - 5:00pm : Host Bindings (JS + DOM) for WebAssembly
Presenter: *Brad Nelson*

WebAssembly currently in practice relies on a substantial amount of support from
JavaScript + Web APIs to be useful on the Web. Interoperability with JavaScript
and Web APIs will help make WebAssembly in practice more "of the Web"
while improving performance and ergonomics. Bindings for non-Web hosts embeddings are also relevant.

[Proposal](https://github.com/flagxor/spec/blob/jsdom/proposals/jsdom/Overview.md)

#### 5:00pm - 6:00pm : Open Discussion

WebAssembly folks and others can discuss topics of interest.
