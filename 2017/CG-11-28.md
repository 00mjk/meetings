## Agenda items

1. Opening, welcome and roll call
    1. Opening of the meeting
    1. Introduction of attendees
1. Find volunteers for note taking (acting chair to volunteer)
1. Adoption of the agenda
1. Proposals and discussions
    1. Review of action items from prior meeting.
    1. Meeting times + collaborators in Asia-Pacific
       * Discussion of meeting time logistics
       * POLL: We should hold every third video call at an APAC friendly time.
       * POLL: We should time the meeting to avoid conflict with TC39.
    1. The name of WebAssembly.Global
       * See [WebAssembly/threads/issues/49](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/issues/49),
         discussion stalled
       * Poll-worthy?
    1. The type of immutable globals exported from instances
       * See [WebAssembly/threads/issues/73](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/issues/73),
         discussion stalled
       * Basically, either change existing API incompatibly or live with complex API
       * Poll-worthy?
    1. The type of the wake count argument and return value for atomic.wake
       * Spec text changed this to i64 but poll at CG mildly in favor of older i32:
       
         SA | A | N | F | SF
         |----|---|---|---|----|
         2 | 2 | 11 | 4 | 0
       
       * Would be good to nail this down now, code is landing in implementations
       * Discussions bogged down on what TC39 may or may not want to do
       * POLL: Revert to i32 with trapping in (the implausible) case of overflow
    1. Conditional Segment Initalization instructions `init_memory`/`init_table`
       * See [WebAssembly/threads/pull/79](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/pull/79)
       * POLL: Should we limit these instructions to only being valid during instantiation?
1. Closure

## Agenda items for future meetings

1. Require custom sections after all known sections
   * See [WebAssembly/design/issues/1153](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1153)

### Schedule constraints
