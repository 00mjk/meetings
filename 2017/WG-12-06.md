         Brad is not a lawyer.
       * [Link](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/)
       * W3C documents progress thru several steps:
          * [First Public Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#first-wd)
          * [Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#revised-wd) - Some number of revisions.
          * [Candidate Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#last-call)
          * [Proposed Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#rec-pr)
       * [Changes can roll back the process](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#rec-modify)
          * During Working Draft this only requires that we document what
            has changed.
          * During later phases this can reset the entire process
            (for substantive changes).
          * [Classes of changes](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#substantive-change):
             * Editorial
                * No changes to text content
                * Corrections that do not affect conformance
             * Substantive
                * Corrections that do not add new features
                   * Changes conformance of agents.
                * New features
        * General requirements for advancement
           * MUST record the group's decision to request advancement.
           * MUST obtain Director approval.
           * MUST provide public documentation of all substantive changes to the technical report since the previous publication.
           * MUST formally address all issues raised about the document since the previous maturity level.
           * MUST provide public documentation of any Formal Objections.
           * SHOULD provide public documentation of changes that are not substantive.
           * SHOULD report which, if any, of the Working Group's requirements for this document have changed since the previous step.
           * SHOULD report any changes in dependencies with other groups.
           * SHOULD provide information about implementations known to the Working Group.
           * For a First Public Working Draft there is no "previous maturity level", so many requirements do not apply, and approval is normally fairly automatic. For later stages, especially transition to Candidate or Proposed Recommendation, there is usually a formal review meeting to ensure the requirements have been met before Director's approval is given.
        * Requirements for Revised Working Drafts
           * If 6 months elapse without significant changes to a specification
             a Working Group should publish a revised Working Draft,
             whose status section should indicate reasons for the lack
             of change.
           * To publish a revision of a Working draft, a Working Group:
              * MUST record the group's decision to request publication. Consensus is not required, as this is a procedural step,
              * MUST provide public documentation of substantive changes to the technical report since the previous Working Draft,
              * SHOULD provide public documentation of significant editorial changes to the technical report since the previous step,
              * SHOULD report which, if any, of the Working Group's requirements for this document have changed since the previous step,
              * should report any changes in dependencies with other groups,
        * [Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20170801/#sec-Exclusion)
           * "First Public Working Draft" triggers a "Call for Exclusions".
           * Working group members must disclose that they have
             patents for "essential claims" with 150 days
             after "First Public Working Draft".
           * New members joining after "First Public Working Draft" have
             90 days after they join or 150 days after fPWD, which ever is
             shorter to declare their claims.
           * If a member resigns, they are obligated to license all claims
             contained in the latest Working Draft.
              * Resigning members have 60 days to exclude additional material
                in the latest draft. However, only if such material wasn't
                present in the latest working draft published 90 days after
                the fPWD.
    1. Adoption of CG specification
       1. Discussion of state of the core specification + JS & Web embedding.
       1. Adopting a first public working draft.
          * Ramifications:
             * Starts a 150 day clock on WG members (present and future)
               to notify the group of "essential claims".
             * After that 150 days, only new claims based on changes to the
               spec can be excluded (everything else members must license).
             * We have to publish a revised draft at least every 6 months
               after this. It need not have changes, but needs to explain why.
             * When we revise the spec after this point, we have to carefully
               capture a list of what "substantive changes" have occurred,
               publishing that in a revised draft. That draft has a shorter
               clock (60-90 days depending on when someone resigns).
             * If we advance to from Working Draft to Candidate Recommendation
               and then need to change something, the process resets back to 0.
          * POLL: We should adopt the current WebAssembly core + JS & Web
           spec as a "First Public Working Draft" for
           the WebAssembly Specification v.1.
