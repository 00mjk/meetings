## Agenda items

1. Opening, welcome and roll call
    1. Opening of the meeting
    1. Introduction of attendees
1. Find volunteers for note taking (chair to volunteer).
1. Adoption of the agenda
1. Proposals and discussions
    1. Discussion of W3C Process.
       * NOTE: All of this is based on Brad's understanding of W3C docs.
         Brad is not a lawyer.
       * [Presention Details](WG-12-06-process.md)
    1. Adoption of CG specification
       1. Discussion of state of the core specification + JS & Web embedding.
       1. Adopting a first public working draft.
          * Ramifications:
             * Starts a 150 day clock on WG members (present and future)
               to notify the group of "essential claims".
             * After that 150 days, only new claims based on changes to the
               spec can be excluded (everything else members must license).
             * We have to publish a revised draft at least every 6 months
               after this. It need not have changes, but needs to explain why.
             * When we revise the spec after this point, we have to carefully
               capture a list of what
               ["substantive changes"](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#substantive-change)
               have occurred,
               publishing that in a revised draft. That draft has a shorter
               clock (60-90 days depending on when someone resigns).
             * If we advance from Working Draft to Candidate Recommendation
               and then need to change something, the process resets back to 0.
          * POLL: We should adopt the current WebAssembly core + JS & Web
           spec as a "First Public Working Draft" for
           the WebAssembly Specification v.1.
