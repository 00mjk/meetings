       1. [ash-nazg](https://github.com/w3c/ash-nazg/) integration for spec repo
          * ash-nazg watches for PRs (not branch merges) from folks who are
            not members of a {W,C}G. There's an
            [interface](https://labs.w3.org/hatchery/repo-manager/pr/open)
            being substantial vs. editorial.
            For example, in the bottom of
            [this](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/pull/1190
            you'll see "All checks have
            passed". To the right, click <Show all checks> and you'll see
            "ipr â€” PR deemed acceptable".
            [Example Diff](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pr-preview/w3c/ServiceWorker/0aefcc4...948e077.html)
       1. Given that ash-nazg can be used for checking WG membership,
          should be consider using an https//github.com/w3c/webassembly-spec
          repo?
    1. Adoption of CG specification
       1. Discussion of state of the core specification + JS & Wed embedding.
       1. POLL: We should adopt the current WebAssembly core spec as
          a "First Public Working Draft" for WebAssembly Specification v.1.
