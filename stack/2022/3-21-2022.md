1. Effect handlers in C++ (Maciej Pir√≥g)

   In this talk, I'll discuss the design of a C++ library for (one-shot) effect handlers built on top of a simple stack-switching mechanism. The library is type-safe, has a readable API, and the performance doesn't seem to be a dealbreaker. While it is *just* a library, I'll focus on the aspects that might be relevant to compilation of native effect handlers, such as memory management and dealing with value types.
