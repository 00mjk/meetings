# Day-of event process

## Agenda

The meeting invitation contains an agenda which will be updated through pull
requests in the days leading up to the meeting. Champions for individual
features are expected to provide details of their proposal in a timely fashion
so that attendees may review the material ahead of time. Champions are also
expected to provide a list of questions on which attendees will be polled for
[consensus](consensus.md). Some meetings may have an overall "theme" which
guides which proposals should be discussed in that meeting.

The chair will cover the agenda in order. One of the first items covered
involves adoption of the agenda, at which point the group may elect to modify
the agenda.

Attendees are expected to familiarize themselves with the proposals before the
meeting. It is not acceptable to stall the meeting due to lack of preparation.

## Notes

Notes are taken throughout the meeting by a designated note-taker (who may
change throughout the day). Names of each participants, their affiliated company
/ institution, and what is discussed, are recorded in the notes. This
establishes where ideas came from, and how they came about. Before posting the
notes to the meeting document, the notes are sent out to attendees to verify
correctness. Notes are subsequently posted to the meeting document, no later
than two weeks after the meeting.

[Consensus](consensus.md) is recorded in the notes.

## Conduct

The usual
[WebAssembly code of conduct](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md)

interactions.
