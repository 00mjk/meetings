# Determining consensus

Consensus is critical in a standards process:

* Gathering consensus helps champions guide their proposal with confidence.
* Consensus prevents needlessly revisiting topics unless new information
  surfaces warranting such revisitation.
* If members don't believe that their voices are heard then the process can,
  over time, break down. Recording dissent is therefore a critical part of
  building consensus.

Champions are expected to list points for which they will seek consensus in the
meeting agenda, and new consensus points can be added in-person as the
discussion proceeds.

Polling consensus is done by the chair:

1. The champion asks a question, which is written down for all to see. Multiple
   related consensus points could be polled back-to-back, in which case they are
   all declared before polling takes place.
2. The chair asks all participants to express their opinion to the question,
   asking in turn whether they are `Strongly For`, `For`, `Neutral`, `Against`,
   or `Strongly Against`. Participants vote for a single option by raising their
   hand, or abstain entirely. Aggregate votes are recorded by the note-taker.
3. If deemed relevant, the chair can ask certain participants if their wish to
   explain their vote for the note-taker.
4. The chair determines whether consensus was reached.

There is no specific number of votes required to establish or block
consensus. In some circumstances a single implementor's or user's concerns may,
at the chair's discretion, block consensus. That being said, it is critical that
all participants believe the consensus process works! The chair must strive for
consensus on consensus.

Lack of consensus doesn't necessarily prevent an idea from being revisited
later. "More information requested" or "request more work" are acceptable
outcomes for lack of consensus.

## Decision process

As per the [Community Group charter](https://webassembly.github.io/cg-charter/):

    This Group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus. Groups are
    free to decide how to make decisions (e.g. Participants who have earned
    Committer status for a history of useful contributions assess consensus, or
    the Chair assesses consensus, or where consensus isn't clear there is a Call
    for Consensus [CfC] to allow multi-day online feedback for a proposed course
    of action). It is expected that participants can earn Committer status
    through a history of valuable contributions as is common in open source
    projects. After discussion and due consideration of different opinions, a
    decision should be publicly recorded (where GitHub is used as the resolution
    of an Issue).

    If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the Group is divided) and the
    Group needs to decide an Issue in order to continue to make progress, the
    Committers will choose an alternative that had substantial support (with a
    vote of Committers if necessary). Individuals who disagree with the choice
    are strongly encouraged to take ownership of their objection by taking
    ownership of an alternative fork. This is explicitly allowed (and preferred
    to blocking progress) with a goal of letting implementation experience
    inform which spec is ultimately chosen by the Group to move ahead with.

    Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded in
    a GitHub Issue for Groups that use GitHub and otherwise on the Group's
    public mail list. Any Group participant may object to a decision reached at
    an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of publication of the decision
    provided that they include clear technical reasons for their objection. The
    Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the objection according
    to the decision process.

    It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
    fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour or
    discriminate against any Group participant or their employer.
