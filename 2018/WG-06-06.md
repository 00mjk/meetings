    1. Brad Nelson is planning to leave his role as WebAssembly Working Group chair.
       Brad has recommended Ben Smith as his replacement due to his experience with the
       CG & WG, and his recent experience as CG co-chair.
       
       In this matter, [our charter](https://www.w3.org/2017/08/wasm-charter)
       defers to [W3C Process](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#member-rep)
       which ditates that the role of [chair](https://www.w3.org/Guide/chair/role.html)
       is appointed by the W3C Director. This is typically done in consultation with
       our W3C team member Eric.
       
       Eric has indicate he will likely convey my advice to the director, however,
       in the interest of open decisions, I would like to have an explicit poll.
       * POLL: The Wasm WG should recommend that Ben Smith become our new WG chair.
