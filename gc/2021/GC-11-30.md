### Presentation: Isorecursive types in Wob and Waml (Andreas Rossberg, 30 minutes)

TODO: slides

TL: Can you remind us what the signature information in the custom section for Wob is?

AR: It maps exported module items

FM: As a practical matter you probably wouldn’t want to track order of declarations in the source. For example changing order of declaration in Java should not break anything.

AR: Not sure it’s a practical concern if you have to recompile after reordering things, but you could go with the normalization solution instead.

FM: Common situation is adding more functionality to a module, which would change its recursion group.

AR: In that case, you have to recompile your consumers anyway.

FM: Not in e.g. Java. This is important.

AR: Right, but we have a working assumption that our separate compilation is more similar to C++ where you might need to recompile even if you change private layout information. That’s a limitation I am ok with accepting for now.

TL: We used to have type ordering in Binaryen but it was subtly wrong and we ended up just deleting it. For ordering items in a rec group, did you have to consider supertypes to break ties between otherwise equivalent types?

AR: Supertypes would be part of the syntax that is being ordered in the first place. Another note: multiple supertypes (in the future) would need their order canonicalized.

LW: Why do the SCCs (which form a DAG) need to be ordered?

AR: So that the type indices referring to types in previous SCCs have stable numbers.

PC (chat): Can't you have some kind of equivalent problems of ordering if there are 2 exactly equivalent types but that are exported? Would you also need to canonicalise the orders of exports too?

AR: This implementation does not use type imports and exports. Exports wouldn’t make a difference, but you would have to canonicalize the order of imports, probably based on the name, since you might not have other information. This would depend on all modules using the same import names, which seems reasonable.

FM: 200 lines of change to Wob. What is that as a percentage?

AR: About 5600 lines total for Wob. Waml is 12000 (but might be counting the wrong thing). Definitely on the order of several thousand lines each.

TL: For the question of whether the isorecursive system is powerful enough because of its limited (i.e. non-structural) subtyping, do we think that falling back to a more general/uniform representation would always work?

AR: Yes, in the extreme case you would have to cast on every access, but of course you want to minimize that. Neither Waml nor Wob need recursion+structural+subtyping and I don’t think any language categories I am familiar with would need that, so I think that shouldn’t commonly come up.

FM: Smalltalk?

AR: Wouldn’t be able to depend on the Wasm type system.

AZ: This was very helpful to understand the tools side. Do you have an idea of how it would impact the VM side compared to nominal?

AR: The engine would have to canonicalize everything up front then proceed as with nominal. I don’t think this should be too much work. All the responsibility for dealing with the complexities of recursion are shifted to the producer.

MK (chat): Could you remind me: how do you distinguish two rec groups that happen to be identical if your source language has nominal semantics? Do you still need to implement your own type system on top with type tags?

AR: Wasm type system is not supposed to maintain all the type distinctions of the source language. For example when compiling to linear memory, you lose all distinctions completely. The goal is only to describe data layout to the engine for efficient and safe access, not to enforce variants from the source. If you want to enforce more invariants, you have to encode that information separately.
